// If we just do "export * from", our index.[m]js file ends up with "export" statement as well, thus causing runtime errors.
// Another option is rename .d.ts files into .ts files and end up with a bunch of empty .[m]js files and index.[m]js exporting those - not very optimal either.export * from "./headers";
